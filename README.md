# Front End Test

Estimated Time: 30 mins

### Setup Instructions:

Clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com/ThirdSpaceLearning/front-end-test.git
```

and open the index.html from the file system or terminal.

### Dependencies:

None.

### Task: 

1. Style the attached `index.html` file using **only** CSS, based on the mockup. No HTML elements may be modified, added, or removed.

2. Using JavaScript or jQuery, build an event handler that achieves the following:
  
  a. Disable the 'Submit' button after it has been clicked and change its background color to #ddd.
  
  b. Change the text of 'Sign up for a free demo!' to 'Thank you. We will be in touch shortly.'

The font used is Helvetica, and the shade of purple used is rgba(99,41,177,1).

### Rules, Hints & Tips:

1. Bootstrap, Foundation, and other front-end/CSS libraries may not be used. If you have a Sass or Less compiler already installed on your machine you may use it, but we recommend using plain old CSS.
2. Get as far as you can within 30 minutes. We prefer to see well-structured, unfinished code over completed but incomprehensible code.
