# Front End Test

Estimated Time: 30 mins

Task: 

1. Style the attached `index.html` file using **only** CSS, based on the mockup. No HTML elements may be modified, added, or removed.

2. Using JavaScript or jQuery, build two event handlers:
  a. Disable the 'Submit' button after it has been clicked
  b. Change the text of 'Sign up for a free demo!' to 'Thank you. We will be in touch shortly.'
  c. Slide out the navigation menu on mouseover.

Rules, Hints & Tips:

1. Bootstrap, Foundation, and other front-end/CSS libraries may not be used. Although we use SCSS in production, for the purposes of this test plain old CSS will be used.
2. Get as far as you can within 30 minutes, but think about how to prioritise tasks such that the greatest business value is added.
3. Try to choose variable names that are clear and reusable.
